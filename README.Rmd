For simulating five-card draw poker scenarios

## Installation

You can install the released version of fivecarddraw from Github

``` r
remotes::install_github("mkearney/fivecarddraw")
```

## Example

Start a round of five-card draw

```{r example}
## start a game with five players
p <- Poker$new(players = 5)

## shuffle
p$shuffle()

## deal
p$deal()

## show cards
p$peek()

## draw cards
p$draw()

## NOTE:

This package was inspired by a question about five-card draw from my father-in-law. It isn't scientific and it's a work in progress.
